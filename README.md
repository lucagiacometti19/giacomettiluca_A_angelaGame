## Angela Game âœ¨
One of the oldest game ever developed. Back in 1965, this game was created for the "Olivetti Programma 101", considered the first computer ever created by the humanity.

#### Characteristics
This is obviously not the original version, but an adaptation for Arduino. The original Angela Game was actually a pretty hard game; this one, instead, is much easier since it's player vs player.
